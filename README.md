# 🧠 React State Management: Counter Application Series

This project demonstrates **multiple approaches to state management** in React applications using a simple interactive counter. It begins with the basic use of `useState`, then moves to React’s `Context API`, and finally implements global state with `Redux Toolkit`.

---

## 📚 Project Structure

Each version of the counter app illustrates a different state management technique:

| Folder          | Description                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `0x04-useState/` | Local component state with `useState`              |
| `0x05-context/`  | Global state using `Context API`                   |
| `0x06-redux/`    | Global state using `Redux Toolkit` + `React-Redux` |

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project series, you will:

- Understand fundamental React state management using `useState`
- Implement global state with React `Context API`
- Master `Redux Toolkit` for complex state scenarios
- Share and persist state across components
- Grasp the concept of a **single source of truth**
- Evaluate and compare different state management techniques
- Learn to structure applications for scalability and performance

## 🧰 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sahe20/alx-project-0x04-setup.git
   cd alx-project-0x04
   npm install
   or
   yarn install

   npm run dev
   or
   yarn dev

Open in browser:
Visit http://localhost:3000

## 🚀 Best Practices Followed
Type-safe with TypeScript

Single responsibility principle

Separation of concerns (UI vs logic)

Proper modular folder structure

Optimized with memoization and typed selectors/hooks

Persistent and scalable state design

## 🧠 Insights Gained
State management is context-dependent.

Simpler tools like useState work well for localized logic.

Context is great for moderate, shared app state.

Redux excels at managing large-scale, side-effect-heavy applications.
